Hello-World intro

Hello Everyone!

My name is Mathew Smyth and I'm a huge PC game nerd.
I spent 5 years in the military right after high school and am trying to find 
my new passion.
I have always loved computers but never imagined learning how to code.
A lot of what I know about computers has been self taught.
